Topic: Linux Fundamentals

1. Introduction to DevOps
DevOps is a combination of Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops). It focuses on collaboration, automation, continuous integration, and faster delivery of software.
Key Goals of DevOps:
•	• Faster software delivery
•	• Improved collaboration between teams
•	• Automation of processes
•	• Continuous monitoring and feedback
2. Linux Basics
Linux is an open-source operating system widely used in servers, cloud platforms, and DevOps environments.
Important Linux Commands
1.	pwd – Displays present working directory
2.	ls – Lists files and directories
3.	ls -l – Shows detailed file information
4.	ls -a – Shows hidden files
5.	cd – Change directory
6.	mkdir – Create new directory
7.	touch – Create empty file
8.	cp – Copy files
9.	mv – Move or rename files
10.	rm – Remove files
11.	rm -rf – Force delete directory and contents

3. Linux vs Windows
Windows:
•	• Developed by Microsoft
•	• GUI based
•	• Paid license
•	• Mostly used in personal computers
Linux:
•	• Open-source and free
•	• More secure and stable
•	• Mostly command-line based
•	• Preferred in servers and cloud
4. Virtual Machine (VM)
A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software-based computer that runs inside another physical computer.
Why VM is used:
•	• Run multiple operating systems
•	• Testing and development
•	• Safe environment for experiments
Key Terms:
•	• Host OS – Main operating system
•	• Guest OS – OS installed inside VM
•	• Hypervisor – Software that creates VMs (VMware, VirtualBox)
5. WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
WSL allows Linux to run directly inside Windows without installing a full virtual machine.
Advantages:
•	• Lightweight
•	• Faster than VM
•	• Easy setup
6. VMware Installation Overview
Steps Summary:
16.	1. Create Broadcom account
17.	2. Download VMware Workstation Pro
18.	3. Disable Hyper-V and conflicting features
19.	4. Enable virtualization in BIOS
20.	5. Install VMware and restart system
7. Ubuntu Server Installation (Summary)
•	• Create new virtual machine
•	• Select Ubuntu ISO file
•	• Allocate RAM and CPU
•	• Install Ubuntu Server
•	• Create user and password
•	• Enable OpenSSH (optional)
•	• Reboot and login
8. System Update Command
Keep system updated using:
